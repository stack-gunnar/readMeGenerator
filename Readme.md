## Description
I created a program that will ask questions using the Inquirer prompt. Then it will take the users input from the prompt and put that input into a styled and formatted ReadMe.md file. Saving the user valuable time.

## Installation

Head to my [Github Repo](https://github.com/stack-gunnar) and clone down the readMeGenerator repo.

To use this application you will need to have a GitBash terminal, and Node.js. Once you have those move into the readMeGenerator directory in your GitBash Terminal

Then type "node index.js" and the prompt to fill out your own ReadMe.md file will appear. Fill out the prompts and like magic your completed ReadMe.md file will appear in the readMeGenerator directory.
